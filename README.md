# Sentiment-Analysis

Sentiment analysis of Amazon phone review :The analysis was done through distilbert-base-uncased model from  hugging face. The program was then integrated with fastAPI and Flask  and was developed into a web application were a user can first sign  up and then sign in, then upload the csv file which contains the review.  The sentiment analysis was done as a background task and the result  was stored in PostgreSQL database in json format. The result was then  displayed as a table by interacting with the database using  SQLAlchemy.  JWT tokens were used for authentication and authorization of users. The  API was designed to handle HTTP exceptions. Pydantic models were  used to validate requests and responses and python logging to log  errors and information. Typing was implemented for all functions. Pytest  was used to test the functions used in the application.  The application was finally deployed in docker. A docker compose was  used, with separate docker containers for PostgreSQL and FastAPI.
